In input.cpp, the askYesOrNo function appears to be returning a 1 value without running the loop
Possibly because the while loop function is trying to run while the first letter is 'y' or 'n'

In main:
-I have added the "#include ###.cpp" files to be able to test on my machine 
    without runnning through the command window, we can delete them before the 
    final submission (Daniel)
-validate that the wager increase cannot be more than the original bet
-validate that the original wager cannot be more than the player balance
